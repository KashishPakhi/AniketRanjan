      <p class="bio">You have a way of putting people at ease with a simple joke, and you always include everyone in the fun instead of using your humor to put someone down.

I love your optimistic nature. You always try to see the good in every person and situation, even when I can't see it myself. When I look at the world through your eyes, it's a better place </p>
